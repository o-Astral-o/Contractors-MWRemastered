I finally decided to release the source code for my Contractor$ VR mods as i've since moved on to other projects and have no need for it anymore.

`You are free to use this however you like, though please give a credit as alot of hard work and passion went into making these mods.`

This is meant as more of an addon to your modkit that you can use to see how i achieved certain things that aren't made available in the default Contractor$ VR kit such as camo systems, player progression, unlock systems etc. or to use the weapons in things like CoDz maps.

`This isn't meant for you to just download and upload as your own.`
